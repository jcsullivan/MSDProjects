As far as I know, this program requires all the files in the various directories of this particular directory.

In order to start the program, please run "/usr/local/bin/python3 encfs.py test/ mountpoint" with the password "password".

Then, in another terminal window, attempt to access the mountpoint/ files, as indicated by the assignment instructions.
